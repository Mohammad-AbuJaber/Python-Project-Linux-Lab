# Python-Project-Linux-Lab

In this Python project, we will be building management software using object-oriented programming (OOP) for a large company that owns multiple supermarkets. The software will be responsible for managing the products in the warehouse and the distribution of these products to the supermarkets.

The software will provide the following functionalities:
Â 
- Add product items to the warehouse;
- Add a new supermarket to the management system;
- List of items in the warehouse based on expiration date;
- Clear an item from the warehouse;
- Distribute products from the warehouse to a supermarket;
- Generate a report about the sales status of the warehouse;
- Exit.

This management software was implemented using OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. We created classes to represent the various entities in the system. These classes have methods to handle the various functionalities mentioned above.

Overall, this project will provide a practical example of using OOP concepts in Python to build management software for a real-world scenario.
